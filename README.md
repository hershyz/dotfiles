# dotfiles

Currently just my GPT'd nvim config

#### TODO (in order of importance):
- [ ] Native `cmd + c`, `cmd + x`, `cmd + v` functionality
- [ ] Comments (like `cmd + /` functionality on vscode)
- [ ] `()`, `[]`, and `{}` wrapping a selection
- [ ] Mapping for selection of entire buffer + ability to delete/write over directly afterwards
- [ ] Smooth scrolling?
- [ ] Move to lazy.nvim?

#### Notes on iterm2
- Allow application keypad mode
