Currently just my GPT'd nvim config

#### TODO (in order of importance):
- [X] Native-like buffer selection funcionality
- [X] Native-like `cmd + c`, `cmd + x`, `cmd + v` functionality
- [ ] Tab/shift+tab on selected buffer (move multiple lines right/left)
- [ ] Comments (like `cmd + /` functionality on vscode)
- [ ] `()`, `[]`, and `{}` wrapping a selection within a buffer
- [ ] Mapping for selection of entire buffer + ability to delete/write over directly afterwards
- [ ] Smooth scrolling?
- [ ] Move to lazy.nvim?

#### For iterm2
- Allow application keypad mode `(settings -> profiles -> keys -> general)`
- Set iterm2 hex code sequences `(settings -> profiles -> keys -> key bindings)`
```
- cmd+a -> 0x1b 0x61
- cmd+c -> 0x1b 0x63
- cmd+v -> 0x1b 0x76
- cmd+x -> 0x1b 0x78
```
