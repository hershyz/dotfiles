# dotfiles

Currently just my GPT'd nvim config

### TODO:
- [ ] Native `cmd + c`, `cmd + x` functionality
- [ ] Mapping for selection of entire buffer + ability to delete/write over directly afterwards
- [ ] Comments (like `cmd + /` functionality on vscode)
- [ ] Smooth scrolling?
- [ ] Move to lazy.nvim?
