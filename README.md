Currently just my nvim config and some iterm2 keymaps.  
Definitely not a template, meant to feel as Mac-native as possible.  
Additional notes/non-nvim (iterm2) configs at the bottom of `init.lua`.

#### TODO (in rough order of importance):
- [X] Native-like buffer selection funcionality
- [X] Native-like `cmd + c`, `cmd + x`, `cmd + v` functionality
- [X] Native-like `cmd + [arrow]` functionality
- [ ] Git integration (gitsigns)
- [ ] Separate keymaps for grep on all files in src dir versus current buffer
- [ ] Tab/shift+tab on selected buffer (move multiple lines right/left)
- [ ] Comments (like `cmd + /` functionality on vscode)
- [ ] Keymap to jump through warnings/errors in current buffer
- [ ] `()`, `[]`, and `{}` wrapping a selection within a buffer
- [ ] Native-like `cmd + s`, `cmd + z` functionality
- [X] Mapping for selection of entire buffer + ability to delete/write over directly afterwards
- [X] Smooth scrolling?
- [ ] Move to lazy.nvim for plugin management?
